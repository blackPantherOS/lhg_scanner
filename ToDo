ToDo:
=====

#0003
lhg-service should store IDs only, if unique (e.g. ignoring USB Hubs with repeating IDs)

#0004
Search for cached scan data, if upload failed. Upload at later time, if connection is up again.

#0005
use /etc configuration file for anonymous ID and possibility of linking to www.linux-hardware-guide.com user account

#0006
Store scan date (needed if upload failed)

Fixed:
======
