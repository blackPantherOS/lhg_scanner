ToDo:
=====

#0003
lhg-service should store IDs only, if unique (e.g. ignoring USB Hubs with repeating IDs)

#0004
Search for cached scan data, if upload failed. Upload at later time, if connection is up again.

#0005
use /etc configuration file for anonymous ID and possibility of linking to www.linux-hardware-guide.com user account

#0006
Store scan date (needed if upload failed)

#0007
system message if upload was successful. provide output url

#0008
install icon in toolbar

#0009
notifyer message if new hardware is found

#0010
graphical frontend if started under X (configure user account, link to help pages, show old scan results, initiate scan, ...)

#0011
store all upload IDs to allow users to see their history of uploads

#0012
MAC address anonymizer fails

#0013
Let (anonymous) user check, if uploads were included or help is needed - set corresponding flag for upload ID on server

#0014
Post-install configuration of user data (ask: anonymous or mail address?)

Fixed:
======

#0002  2015-07-04
